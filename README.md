# MyReads Project

This is  myreads web project for [Udacity FEWD Nanodegree.](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) The bookshelf application allows you to select and classify the books you have read, are currently reading or want to read.

## To run locally:

`git clone https://github.com/GuschinS/reactnd-project-myreads.git`

`cd reactnd-project-myreads`

`npm install`

`npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
